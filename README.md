# About me

- ðŸ”­ After my graduation as a **bioengineer** specialized in forest and nature environment, Iâ€™ve started a PhD at **Q-ForestLab**, in Ghent University, Belgium. My work consists of understanding the impact of forest structure on the microclimate buffering capacity in tropical rainforests. And especially, in the Australian Wet Tropics.
  
- Data collection: spatial data have been collected using a **Terrestrial Laser Scanning** (TLS) device (RIEGL VZ-400i) - **microclimate** data have been collecting using Lascar loggers (EL-USB-2)
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to extract key structural metrics from 3D point cloud data (canopy height distribution, canopy cover, Pgap, PAI, PAVD, ...) using mostly ***pylidar* Python library** and ***lidR* R package**.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ If you have any good script, package, model that could help me with this work, feel free to share them with me! And same, if you need any information about my work, I'm open to any type of question!
